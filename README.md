:pushpin:##Difference between margin or padding:

If you enter 4 values, they will be applied clockwise, starting from the top. You can shorten this process to entering 2 values, in which case the browser applies the first value to the top and bottom and the second to left and right.

margin: 10px 20px 10px 8px --> top / right / bottom / left

margin: 10px 20px --> vertical(top/down) / Horizontal(left/right)

:pushpin:###margin: auto;

Margin's auto value is automatically calculated by the browser for the maximum value.

:pushpin:##Tip for selecting and image online:

When you want to include an image from the internet on your web page, always use an image that is twice the size that it would be when displayed on your web page. Doing so would ensure a high resolution display of the image. For example, if teh image's size required on your webpage is 200x200, then the image file size should be 400x400.
