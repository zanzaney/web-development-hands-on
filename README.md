### :pushpin:Difference between margin or padding:
If you enter 4 values, they will be applied clockwise, starting from the top. You can shorten this process to entering 2 values, in which case the browser applies the first value to the top and bottom and the second to left and right.

margin: 10px 20px 10px 8px --> top / right / bottom / left

margin: 10px 20px --> vertical(top/down) / Horizontal(left/right)


### :pushpin:margin: auto;
Margin's auto value is automatically calculated by the browser for the maximum value.

### :pushpin:Tip for using an image in your webpage:
When you want to include an image from the internet on your web page, always use an image that is twice the size that it would be when displayed on your web page. Doing so would ensure a high resolution display of the image. For example, if teh image's size required on your webpage is 200x200, then the image file size should be 400x400.

### :pushpin:File size:
File size is very important as it affects the speed of the webpage loading. Many online tools can be used to compress images. Image file sizes more than 1 MB are not preferable.

### :pushpin:0px vs 0:
Though 0px is not a wrong syntax, not using the unit with 0 is preferred in CSS as the code is clear in that case.

### :pushpin:Use of ```alt``` attribute while using images:
```alt``` is an abbreviation for ```alternate```. Hence, if due to some reason the image is not rendered by the browser, the textual alternative is displayed.

### :pushpin:Use of shadow colour other than black:
Though usually shadow's colour is specified as black by most developers, it is not preferred to use black as the shadow colour for all background colours. Instead, the shadow colour should ideally be darker than the background colour.
